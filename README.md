Cherry: Online Ruby Code Editor and RSpec Tester (REPL)
=======================================================

Edit/run/test your Ruby code directly online with my online Ruby code editor---an online IRB and RSpec tester! I use [JRuby Sandbox](https://github.com/omghax/jruby-sandbox) to prevent malicious code (like "system" commands) from getting through. You must use at least version 0.2.2! I use the [Ace Editor] (http://ace.c9.io/) integrated with Rails, implemented through the [jQuery-ace-rails] (https://github.com/cheef/jquery-ace-rails) gem.

I use AJAX and jQuery throughout, so you don't need to reload the main page. Thus my site works super fast!

## To Use

1. Upload your RSpec test code (with no "require_relative" or "spec_helper" statements). 

2. Upload your Ruby code.

3. With 1 click, run RSpec test against your Ruby code!

4. Edit Ruby code directly in browser! Save on your computer.

## Issues

1. Code editor does not work with "gets" statement.
2. Code editor freezes during infinite loops. 

I am adding multiple testers and multiple coders, so companies/schools may use this to test the software skills of job applicants/students.
