Online RSpec tester and Ruby REPL!

Upload your RSpec test code (with no "require_relative" or "spec_helper" statements). The code ignores them and puts in the right "require_relative" line.

Upload your Ruby code.

With 1 click, run RSpec test against your Ruby code!

Also, I have a primitive Ruby REPL. Needs more work. I use jruby_sandbox to sandbox it.
