Online RSpec tester and online Ruby code editor (REPL)!

Upload your RSpec test code (with no "require_relative" or "spec_helper" statements). The code ignores them and puts in the right "require_relative" line.

Upload your Ruby code.

With 1 click, run RSpec test against your Ruby code!

Edit/run your code directly online with my online Ruby code editor---very similar to IRB! Needs more work. I use jruby_sandbox to sandbox it, but JRuby Sandbox is not secure now. Also, you may not use "gets" statement.
