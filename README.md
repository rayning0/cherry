Cherry: Online Ruby Code Editor and RSpec Tester (REPL)
=======================================================

Add/edit/run your Ruby code directly online with my online Ruby code editor---an online IRB! I use [JRuby Sandbox](https://github.com/omghax/jruby-sandbox) to prevent malicious code (like "system" commands) from getting through. You must use at least version 0.2.2! Code editor does not work with "gets" statement, plus it freezes during infinite loops. I use the [Ace Editor] (http://ace.c9.io/) integrated with Rails, implemented through the [jQuery-ace-rails] (https://github.com/cheef/jquery-ace-rails) gem.

## To Use

1. Upload your RSpec test code (with no "require_relative" or "spec_helper" statements). 

2. Upload your Ruby code.

3. With 1 click, run RSpec test against your Ruby code!

4. Edit Ruby code directly in browser!

I am adding multiple testers and multiple coders, so companies/schools may use this to test the software skills of job applicants/students.
